Hello! This is my first post on my blog, hopefully one of many others! This blog will be used to share my experiences, personal projects, experiments, and other musings about computer graphics and rendering.<br>
<br>
I always enjoyed and appreciated computer graphics in games. Earliest memories included playing around with Crysis and its extensive amount of beautiful and realistic graphical effects. I would see what changing various settings did to the game visually and read up on the game's many then-sophisticated graphical techniques. It amazed me the things the game did to try its best to mirror reality and intrigued me what was done to make them happen.<br>
<br>
This admiration and appreciation for realism and beauty in video games carries on today through my goals and endeavors with graphics. Studios push the boundaries on beauty and realism in rendering in a pursuit of getting closer and closer to reality, and I want to take part in this pursuit.<br>
<br>
This blog will be an archive of my personal pursuit. I hope that some day this blog will be a large library of my experiments and experiences, written down and archived for me to reflect on and for others to read and perhaps even learn from.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for what this blog holds!
